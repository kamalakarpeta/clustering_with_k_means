# K-Means Clustering Algorithm using Iris Dataset

This repository contains a simplified script for implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm using the iris dataset from scikit-learn. The iris dataset is a popular dataset for machine learning and contains measurements of four features of iris flowers.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the script:

- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using pip:

Shell
pip install matplotlib scikit-learn
## GitHub Repository

The code for this example can be found in the following GitHub repository: [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamalakarpeta/clustering_with_k_means)

## Conclusion

This script demonstrates a simplified implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using the iris dataset. It loads the dataset, initializes the K-Means algorithm, fits the model to the data, and visualizes the results by plotting the data points and cluster centers.

In a real-world application, it is important to preprocess the data and potentially tune the parameters of the K-Means algorithm based on the specific problem. This example serves as a starting point for understanding and implementing the K-Means algorithm.
